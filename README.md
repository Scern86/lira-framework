# Lira Framework.
A compact framework for prototyping.

This is a project where I explore and apply my own skills, as well as innovations in the PHP and JS programming languages.

The project has no end goal; the journey is what matters - continual development.

- Contains a basic Result class, objects inherited from which allow for flexible behavior logic upon different outcomes
